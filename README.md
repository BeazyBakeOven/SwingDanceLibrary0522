# Swing Dancing Obsidian Notebook

When this folder is opened as a vault in the app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), it functions as a wiki of swing dancing moves. 

You may see checkboxes in these files--that's for my reference (moves I've learned/not learned). 

This notebook is still a work in progress, but I've found it to be a very useful reference for learning, practicing, and choreographing swing dancing moves. I hope you do too!
