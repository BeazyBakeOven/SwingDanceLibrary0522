# Swing Dancing Obsidian Notebook

Hello! When this folder is opened as a *Vault* in the app *Obsidian*, it functions as a wiki of swing dancing moves. To look at all the moves, go to [[_Master_List]].

You may see checkboxes in these files--that's for my reference (moves I've learned/not learned). 

This notebook is still a work in progress, but I've found it to be a very useful reference for learning, practicing, and choreographing swing dancing moves. I hope you do too!
